# SimpleCalculator

Simple Android Caluculator app, which simulates work of three types of calculators, Standard, Scientific and Programmer. 
I used one activity and three Fragments.
Few of other elements used in the app:

- ActionMenuBar (top menu bar)
- ActionBarDrawerToggle (drawer toggle button)
- FragmentManager (setting different fragements in main layout)
- DrawerLayout
- ShareActionProvider (for sharing implict intents using other apps)
